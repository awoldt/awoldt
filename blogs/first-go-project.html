        <h1>A Basic Database Migration Tool</h1>
        <p>
          I just finished my first real project with Go and so far have really
          enjoyed this programming language. It’s called “gograte” (go +
          migrate), its a simple database migration CLI tool. For the longest
          time I’ve focused mainly on JavaScript/TypeScript and web dev stuff,
          and I finally decided it's time to learn a new language and level up
          my programming skills. Go seemed powerful and easy enough to learn,
          and at this point in my software developer journey I’m much more
          interested in backend stuff. I want to puke at the thought of having
          to write react components or positioning a stupid button at just the
          perfect spot on the UI, I’ll leave the frontend code to AI at this
          point.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many times I've had the problem of wanting to clone an entire sql
          schema from a remote database to my local db and it's always a pain in
          the ass. I use Datagrip for my database migration and it works nice
          but sometimes it's just too much or confusing while using it. I wanted
          to have a command to run in the terminal to do it quickly and this was
          a perfect opportunity to build a Go CLI program. Working on projects
          like this is the best way to learn in my opinion.
        </p>

        <h2>What i love about GO</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is so easy to read and write. I could come back from a night of
            not working on this project and instantly understand the context of
            the code after glancing at it. Sometimes with javascript I would
            have to read it a couple times over to understand what's going on,
            but something about reading Go code is so simple and I love that.
            Writing it felt like a breeze, and contrary to what's online I LOVE
            the error handling. Having if err != nil on almost every other line
            is such a nice way to handle errors and know exactly what's going
            wrong.
          </li>
          <li>
            Importing packages. Being able to just find any github repo and
            import into the project was strange at first but awesome. It's so
            easy. The standard library is already powerful enough but some
            really awesome package like CLI and PGX made this project so much
            fun to work with
          </li>
          <li>
            Single binary file. It's cool having a single executable file that
            can easily be used in a docker container to run programs is awesome.
            Not having to think about a node modules folder is nice, and you can
            easily build the executable file for any operating system and CPU
            architecture which is super cool.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What i dont like about Go</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I HATE how Go doesn't have a ternary operator. I use ternary
            operators all the time in javascript. Having to have a ugly if/else
            bracket when I could have just done it in a single line pisses me
            off.
          </li>
          <li>
            The struct tags format is so ugly. At first I would always forget
            how to set it up in my struct and it just looks off.
          </li>
          <li>
            The whole concept of public vs private. Having to capitalize a
            function or struct that I want to use outside of a package is just
            dumb. I would like to have an explicit “public” modifier or a
            "export" declaration to clearly show something is being used
            elsewhere.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          So far I’m liking Go and plan to work on other projects in the future.
