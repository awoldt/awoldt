<h1>A Go Database Migration CLI Tool</h1>
<p>
    I just finished my first real project with Go and so far have really enjoyed
    this programming language. It’s called “gograte” (go + migrate), its a
    simple database migration CLI tool. For the longest time I’ve focused mainly
    on JavaScript/TypeScript and web dev stuff, and I finally decided it's time
    to learn a new language and level up my programming skills. Go seemed
    powerful and easy enough to learn, and at this point in my software
    developer journey I’m much more interested in backend stuff. I want to puke
    at the thought of having to write react components or positioning a stupid
    button at just the perfect spot on a UI, I’ll leave the frontend code to AI
    at this point.

    Many times I've had the problem of wanting to clone an entire sql schema
    from a remote database to my local db and it's always a pain in the ass. I
    use Datagrip for my database migration and it works nice, I just needed an
    excuse to build this tool. I wanted to have a command to run in the terminal
    to do it quickly and this was a perfect opportunity to build a Go CLI
    program. Working on projects like this is the best way to learn in my
    opinion.

<h2>What I love about GO</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        It is so easy to read and write. I could come back from a night of not
        working on this project and instantly understand the context of the code
        after glancing at it. Sometimes with javascript I would have to read it
        a couple times over to understand what's going on, but something about
        reading Go code is so simple and I love that. Writing it felt like a
        breeze, and contrary to what's online I LOVE the error handling. Having
        if err != nil on almost every other line is such a nice way to handle
        errors and know exactly what's going wrong.
    </li>
    <li>
        Importing packages. Being able to put an import statement at the top of
        a file with a GitHub URL as the package to import is so clean and easy.
        Instead of building the CLI logic from the ground up (flags and command
        parsing from user input for example). I used this
        <a href="https://cli.urfave.org/" target="_blank">awesome package</a> to
        get a major jumpstart. The Go website for package docs also is super
        helful. Anything you want to know about the standard library or any 3rd
        party package will have nice documentaion (or at least the ones I've
        used so far).
    </li>
    <li>
        Executable files that have all the dependencies baked in. No
        node_modules or bloat to the final program, just a single file. You
        don't even need to have Go installed on the target machine. With
        JavaScript, once you were done with a project, acutally building it and
        hosting it on a container somewhere was not always straightfoward.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What I don't like about Go</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        I HATE how Go doesn't have a ternary operator. I use ternary operators
        all the time in JavaScript. Having an ugly if/else bracket when I could
        have just done it in a single line is so frustrating.
    </li>

    <li>
        The struct tags format is so ugly. I have no idea if I formatted it
        correctly until the program runs and then gets mad at me. I've gotten
        more used to it over time, but I would constanly forget the format when
        I first started writing in Go. Also why tf does it need to be surrounded
        in tick marks? So dumb.
    </li>
    <li>
        The whole concept of public vs private. Having to capitalize a function
        or struct that I want to use outside of a package is just dumb. Also if
        I remember correctly the individual fields on structs that need to be
        used outside the package also need to be capital, so dumb. I would like
        to have an explicit “public” modifier or a "export" declaration to
        clearly show something is being used elsewhere.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    So far I’m loving Go and plan to work on other projects in the future with
    it. You can find the source code for this project
