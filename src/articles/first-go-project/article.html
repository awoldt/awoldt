    I just finished my first real project with Go and so far have really enjoyed
    this programming language. It’s called “gograte” (go + migrate), its a
    simple database migration CLI tool. For the longest time I’ve focused mainly
    on JavaScript/TypeScript and web dev stuff, and I finally decided it's time
    to learn a new language and level up my programming skills. Go seemed
    powerful and easy enough to learn, and at this point in my software
    developer journey I’m much more interested in backend stuff. I want to puke
    at the thought of having to write react components or design a UI, I’ll
    leave the frontend code to AI at this point (Gemini is 3 pro is a BEAST).
</p>

<p>
    Many times I've had the problem of wanting to clone an entire sql schema
    from a remote database to my local db and it's always a pain. I use Datagrip
    for my database migration and it works great, I just needed an excuse to
    build this tool. I wanted to have a command to run in the terminal to do it
    quickly and this was a perfect opportunity to build a Go CLI program.
    Working on projects like this is the best way to learn in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
    The main idea is there is a "target" and "source" database. The source
    database is where all table schemas sit, and the target is the database to
    add these new schemas to. This program features two main commands:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <i>replace</i>
        <p>
            <b>Replace</b> will delete everything in the "target" database
            (deleting all tables and columns within) and replacing with the
            current table/column structure being used on the "source" database.
            All queries executed are wrapped in a transaction so if anything
            goes wrong nothing will be messed up.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>diff</i>
        <p>
            <b>Diff</b> will show the new, removed, and existing tables between
            the two databases. New will be tables that exist in the source but
            not the target, removed will be tables that exist in target but not
            source, and existing will show changes in a table's column that
            exists in both databases.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What I like about GO</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Multiple return values from a function is awesome. The pattern of
        returing an error along with the actual value is a really concise way to
        error handle. There's something that makes me very confident in the code
        I'm writing that I've never felt with JavaScript.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is so easy to read and write. It just feels so simple due to the
        small set of keywords for the language.
    </li>
    <li>
        Importing packages and hosting your Go codebase on GitHub accessible for
        anyone to download is cool.
    </li>
    <li>
        Executable files that have all the dependencies baked in. No
        node_modules or bloat to the final program, just a single file. So easy
        to throw into a docker container and run something in the cloud.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What I don't like about Go</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The reference date of January 2nd, 2006 being used to format date
        strings is confusing at first and I can see how new Go developers might
        not get why this is important. I cannot begin to explain the confustion
        I had whlile working with a date for my first time not understanding the
        significance of this date or why I needed to use it.
    </li>
    <li>
        I HATE how Go doesn't have a ternary operator. I use ternary operators
        all the time in JavaScript. Having an ugly if/else bracket when I could
        have just done it in a single line is so frustrating.
    </li>

    <li>
        The struct tags format is so ugly. I have no idea if I formatted it
        correctly until the program runs and then gets mad at me. Why does it
        need to be surrounded in tick marks? So dumb.
    </li>
    <li>
        The whole concept of public vs private. Having to capitalize a function
        or struct that I want to use outside of a package is just stupid. I
        would like to have an explicit “public” modifier or a "export"
        declaration to clearly show something is being used elsewhere.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    So far I’m loving Go and plan to work on other projects in the future with
    it. You can find the source code for this project
