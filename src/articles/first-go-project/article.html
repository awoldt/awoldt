<h1>A Go Database Migration CLI Tool</h1>
<p>
  I just finished my first real project with Go and so far have really enjoyed
  this programming language. It’s called “gograte” (go + migrate), its a simple
  database migration CLI tool. For the longest time I’ve focused mainly on
  JavaScript/TypeScript and web dev stuff, and I finally decided it's time to
  learn a new language and level up my programming skills. Go seemed powerful
  and easy enough to learn, and at this point in my software developer journey
  I’m much more interested in backend stuff. I want to puke at the thought of
  having to write react components or positioning a stupid button at just the
  perfect spot on a UI, I’ll leave the frontend code to AI at this point.

<p>
  Many times I've had the problem of wanting to clone an entire sql schema from
  a remote database to my local db and it's always a pain in the ass. I use
  Datagrip for my database migration and it works nice but sometimes it's just
  too much or confusing while using it. I wanted to have a command to run in the
  terminal to do it quickly and this was a perfect opportunity to build a Go CLI
  program. Working on projects like this is the best way to learn in my opinion.

<h2>What I love about GO</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    It is so easy to read and write. I could come back from a night of not
    working on this project and instantly understand the context of the code
    after glancing at it. Sometimes with javascript I would have to read it a
    couple times over to understand what's going on, but something about reading
    Go code is so simple and I love that. Writing it felt like a breeze, and
    contrary to what's online I LOVE the error handling. Having if err != nil on
    almost every other line is such a nice way to handle errors and know exactly
    what's going wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    Importing packages. Being able to put an import statement at the top
    of a file with a GitHub URL as the package to import is so clean and easy. Instead of building the
    CLI logic from the ground up (flags and command parsing from user input for
    example) I used this
    <a href="https://cli.urfave.org/" target="_blank">awesome package</a> to get
    a major jumpstart.
  </li>
  <li>
    Single standalone executable file that has all the dependencies baked in . No node_modules or any bs when attempting
    to run your program, it all just works. You don't even need to have Go installed on the target machine. With JavaScript, once you were done with a project, acutally building it and hosting it on a container somewhere was not always straightfoward. There are many files involved with making it run correctly, with Go its just a single file with everything included within it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>What I don't like about Go</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    I HATE how Go doesn't have a ternary operator. I use ternary operators all
    the time in JavaScript. Having an ugly if/else bracket when I could have
    just done it in a single line pisses me off.
  </li>
  <li>
    The struct tags format is so ugly. I have no idea if I formatted it correct
    until the program runs and then gets mad at me. I've gotten more used to it
    over time, but i would constanly forget the format when I first started
    writing in Go. Also why tf does it need to be surrounded in tick marks? So
    dumb.
  </li>
  <li>
    The whole concept of public vs private. Having to capitalize a function or
    struct that I want to use outside of a package is just dumb. I would like to
    have an explicit “public” modifier or a "export" declaration to clearly show
    something is being used elsewhere.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  So far I’m loving Go and plan to work on other projects in the future with it.
  My next project will more than likely be some type of REST API.
