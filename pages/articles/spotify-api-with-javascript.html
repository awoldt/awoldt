            Most developers have at some point integrated an API in their
            application to enrich the user’s experience and allow for personal
            data to be accessed and manipulated. Spotify’s API is a fun and
            exciting way to learn how to work with an API and understand
            authorization flows. Keep in mind that this API is a little more
            difficult to work with and will require a few more steps to access
            the data. You cannot simply start sending requests and getting back
            responses.
          </p>
          <p>
            This article will only demonstrate how to connect and access the
            data in the backend, there is no frontend code here. All code is
            written in JavaScript (you can also use TypeScript if you want). You
            may use any package/module that you like working with and should be
            able to follow along easily. I will be using Express.js for the
            server and axios for making requests, as this is the easiest to set
            up and get something working as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p>Before we begin, make sure you have the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>A Spotify account</p></li>
            <li><p>A Spotify developer account (explained below)</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A Decent understanding of web development and Node.js/Express.js
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>An understanding of Asynchronous code</p></li>
            <li><p>Environment variables</p></li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Create a developer account</h2>
          <p>
            The first step to working with Spotify’s API is creating a developer
            account. Keep in mind that you need a Spotify account already
            created to make a developer account. This is required to access user
            data. First, log in to your Spotify account at<!-- -->
            <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/" target="_blank"
              >https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/</a
            >, then head over to<!-- -->
            <a
              href="https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications"
              target="_blank"
              >https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications</a
            >
            <!-- -->and hit “Create app” and follow the instructions given. Give
            the app whatever name you like, as you can see I already have an app
            called<!-- -->
            <i>music-visualizer</i> created.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/imgs/articles/spotify-dev-dashboard.png"
            alt="spotify developer dashboard screenshot"
            class="img-fluid article-img"
          />
          <h2>Get your Node.js server up and running</h2>
          <p>
            The next step is to get a basic server up and running. Below is my
            Express.js server running on port 8080 and sending the text “Hello”
            once someone requests the root route (‘/’). Don’t worry too much
            about what is sent back from the root route as we will change this
            later.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="hljs language-js">const express = require(&quot;express&quot;);
const app = express();

app.listen(8080, () =&gt; {
  console.log(&quot;App is listening on port 8080!&quot;);
});

app.get(&quot;/&quot;, (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.send(&quot;Hello&quot;);
});</code></pre>
          <p>
            Now that there is a web server ready to take in requests, we can
            start working with the API. Keep your server code off to the side
            for now as we will come back later and start working with it.
          </p>
          <h2>Request an access token</h2>
          <p>
            This is where using the Spotify API can be confusing to work with.
            Most other APIs allow you to send a basic request and get data back,
            no tokens or credentials are needed, but here we are going to need
            an access token to get back Spotify data. Accessing user data using
            the Spotify API used OAuth 2.0 authentication flow. The process of
            accessing this token is slightly complicated so be sure to have all
            of the following steps down before attempting to access data. We
            will need the following for this to work:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Your apps client ID</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A redirect URL pointing back to your app that is also registered
                in your Spotify developer app’s settings (this will be explained
                later)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Defined scopes of what personal data you want to access (will be
                explained later)
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            First off, the client ID can be found inside the dashboard page of
            the app you created in the Spotify developer account. (I blocked out
            my app’s client id for security reasons)
          </p>
          <img
            src="/imgs/articles/spotify-client-id.png"
            alt="spotify application client id inside settings"
            class="img-fluid article-img"
          />
          <p>
            The next thing you need is a redirect URL for Spotify to send users
            after they have accepted or declined access to their Spotify
            data.<strong
              >This redirect HAS TO BE REGISTERED IN THE APP BEFORE ITS PUT TO
              USE.</strong
            >
            <!-- -->To do this, scroll down a bit and click the edit button at
            the bottom of the page. Once in edit mode, you can add multiple
            redirect urls as seen below. Keep in mind that having redirects to
            your app on localhost will be needed if you want to interact with
            the API on your local machine during development. For example, if
            you wanted to redirect a user back to the account page in your
            application, the redirect url would be
            <i>http://localhost:8080/account</i>. You can replace the 8080 port
            with whatever port your server is listening on.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/imgs/articles/spotify-edit-redirect-urls.png"
            alt="edit the redirect urls for your spotify application"
            class="img-fluid article-img"
          />
          <p>
            Now that we have this out of the way, it’s time to create your own
            custom Spotify authorization link. This link will send users to
            Spotify’s website and prompt them to allow or not allow the use of
            your data. The official authorization url on Spotify’s site
            is<i>https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize</i>. You must add now
            add the following queries to the URL. If you are not sure what URL
            queries are,<!-- -->
            <a
              href="https://www.claravine.com/a-query-on-using-query-strings-parameters/"
              title="Learn what url queries"
              >here is an article that explains it well.</a
            >
          </p>
          <ul style="list-style: none">
            <li>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 10px">client_id</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The client ID for your app. Refer to steps above to find
                    client ID.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>response_type</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Don’t worry too much about what this is, just know it is
                    necessary for getting the access token. It must be set to
                    “code”.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>redirect_uri</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    This is the redirect URL you added to your Spotify
                    developers settings above, and it must match EXACTLY what
                    you saved there
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    It is also very important to remember to encode this URL so
                    that your web browser doesn’t throw an error when attempting
                    to redirect users. An encoded URL will look something like
                    this <i>http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Faccount</i>, while
                    the same decoded URL would look like<!-- -->
                    <i>http://localhost:8080/account</i>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                    Scopes represent the different types of data you want to
                    extract from the user.<!-- -->
                    <a
                      href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes"
                      title="Learn all the scopes used for spotify api"
                      >There are many different types of scopes you can use for
                      your app</a
                    >, but for this tutorial, we will be focusing only on the
                    “user-top-read” scope. This scope allows our app to see all
                    the top tracks and artists a person listens to.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Now that we have all the different URL queries required for
            accessing a user’s Spotify data, we now send the user to this link.
            Combine all the queries above and you will get a URL that looks like
            this:
          </p>
          <pre><code class="hljs language-text">https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=xxx&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri=xxx&amp;scope=user-top-read</code></pre>
          <p>
            (The xxx at client_id and redirect_uri should be replaced with the
            correct data)
          </p>
          <p>
            This will send the user to this web page and is where the user will
            log into their Spotify account and accept or decline access to their
            data.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/imgs/articles/spotify-login-screen.png"
            alt="the login screen users who want to use your app will have to sign into"
            class="img-fluid article-img"
          />
          <h2>Use response code to retrieve access token</h2>
          <p>
            Once the user accepts or declines data, Spotify should send the user
            back to your website according to what redirect URL you specified.
            From here we must extract a special code (remember
            response_type=code) from the URL query on our server. With
            Express.js, it is very simple to extract URL queries. Use the req
            object and access the query property then the code value. This is
            what your server code should look like now:
          </p>
          <pre><code>//this page contains the link to the spotify authorization page
//contains custom url queries that pertain to my specific app
app.get(&quot;/&quot;, (req, res) =&gt; {
  res.send(
    &quot;&lt;a href=&#x27;https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=&quot; +
      process.env.CLIENT_ID +
      &quot;&amp;response_type=code&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Faccount&amp;scope=user-top-read&#x27;&gt;Sign in&lt;/a&gt;&quot;

            Also, take note that I utilize environment variables to hide all the
            sensitive Spotify data so that I don’t expose these keys to the
            entire internet. You don’t have to do this with your app, it is
            entirely optional. If you do decide to use environment variables,
            make sure to install the<!-- -->

              >dotenv NPM package</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is what’s happening on the server. The root route
            (http://localhost:8080/) has a link that once clicked sends the user
            to Spotify’s authorization page. Notice the custom URL queries in
            the href attribute. Make sure each one of these queries has
            information that relates to your app and not mine (i.e. you need to
            change client_id and redirect_uri queries). Once this is done
            Spotify will send the user back to the redirect_uri provided,
            specifically to the account route in my app’s case
            (http://localhost:8080/account). If successful, this route will now
            have access to the special code in the URL needed for the access
            token. Notice how the redirect URL is encoded in the redirect_uri
            parameter in the a tag href (and decoded in the Spotify developer
            app’s settings). Now we finally have the code that will allow us to
            request an access token from Spotify.

            Now that we have this POST request set up with all the necessary
            data, your code on the server should look like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code>const queryString = require(&quot;node:querystring&quot;);
const axios = require(&quot;axios&quot;);

app.get(&quot;/account&quot;, async (req, res) =&gt; {
  const spotifyResponse = await axios.post(
      &quot;https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token&quot;,
      queryString.stringify({
        grant_type: &quot;authorization_code&quot;,
        code: req.query.code,
        redirect_uri: process.env.REDIRECT_URI_DECODED,
      }),
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: &quot;Basic &quot; + process.env.BASE64_AUTHORIZATION,
          &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;,
        },
      }
    );
  
  console.log(spotifyResponse.data);
})</code></pre>
          <p>
            The spotifyResponse object is the response from Spotify that
            contains the access token we need to start making API requests. Make
            sure to log this request in your console and see if it worked. In
            the case of my code, this is what happens in the console after
            clicking sign in on the root route:
          </p>
          <img
            src="/imgs/articles/spotify-access-token.webp"
            alt="response from spotify api that contains access code"
            class="img-fluid article-img"
          />
          <h2>Start making API requests</h2>
          <p>
            Finally, after all of that, we have the access token required to
            make Spotify API calls. This token can be found as the access_token
            property of the spotifyResponse object above. This code will
            automatically expire after an hour, and it is up to you as a
            developer what you want to do with this token. You could potentially
            send cookies back to the browser with this access token so that
            users won’t have to continuously sign in to get data<!-- -->
            <i>(follow best security practices)</i>, it’s really up to you at
            this point. I will demonstrate one single API call that can be made
            now that we have this code. Let’s attempt to get the user’s top
            tracks. Send a GET request https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks,
            but we also need a custom header for this request.
          </p>
          <h3>Authorization</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>

                This will be set to a string formatted as<!-- -->
                <i>“Bearer [spotifyResponse_ACCESS_TOKEN]”</i>
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The request in your server should look like this:</p>
          <pre><code>const axios = require(&quot;axios&quot;);
      
const data = await axios.get(
  &quot;https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/top/tracks?limit=50&quot;,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: &quot;Bearer &quot; + {YOUR ACCESS TOKEN GOES HERE},
    },
  }
);</code></pre>
          <p>The response will look like this in the console:</p>
          <img
            src="/imgs/articles/spotify-api-console-response.webp"

            🎉 Congratulations, you just made your first API call to Spotify and
            retrieved actual user data! In the end, the authorization flow will
            be having the user accept data collection from your web app, Spotify
            redirecting to your site with a code that can be exchanged for an
            access token, and finally taking this access token and making API
            calls.
