  Bun is the hottest new tech in JavaScript land and offers an alternative to
  Nodejs. There are a couple of advantages that I've noticed while using Bun so
  far, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to take JavaScript outside of the
  browser. One fantastic framework built for Bun is Hono, a minimalistic web
  framework similar to Express.
</p>

<p>
  Today, you will learn how to set up Bun on your machine, install Hono, and get
  a basic web server running. We will also utilize JSX for our templates (all of
  you React devs will be happy).
</p>

<p style="margin-top: 50px">This site is running on Bun/Hono ðŸ˜„</p>

<h2>Installing Bun</h2>

<p>
  Bun is very easy to install, but it may be more work if you are on Windows. As
  of this writing, Bun has yet to run natively on Windows. If you are on
  Windows, it is recommended that you use Bun within
  <a
    href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install"
    target="_blank"
    >Windows Subsystyem for Linux (WSL).</a
  >
</p>

<p>Installing Bun is as simple as running this command:</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-txt">curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash</code></pre>

<p>
  Once you run that command, check to see if it was successfully installed on
  your machine.
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-txt">bun --version</code></pre>
<p>
  Create a new folder, and in your terminal, we can use Bun to initialize a new
  project. Run:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-txt">bun init</code></pre>
<p>
  This will create a basic template for your Bun application, only we will
  change one thing during this step. On the <i>entry point</i> line of the
  terminal, Bun will default the file name to <i>index.ts</i>, but we want to
  use <i>index.jsx</i>. We need to do this in order to use JSX in our
  application.

<p>
  JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup;
  it is powerful and easy to use. One significant advantage to using Bun is that
  Bun knows how to compile JSX right out of the box; no extra configuration is
  needed. This article will not go into how to write JSX syntax. You can read
  more about that
  <a href="https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx" target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >. JSX is generally easier to learn and read than other JavaScript template
  engines such as EJS, Handlebars, and Pug.
</p>

<h2>Setting up Hono</h2>
<p>
  Another awesome feature of Bun is that it has a built-in package manager. You
  no longer have to use NPM to install your packages, and Bun's version is much
  faster. Similar to NPM, we will run a single command to install the Hono
  package:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-txt">bun install hono</code></pre>

<p>
  Once Hono is installed, we can set up our web server. Inside your
  <i>index.jsx</i> file (which is the root of your project), add the following:
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-jsx">import { Hono } from "hono";
  
const app = new Hono();

Bun.serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: 8080,
});</code></pre>

<p>
  These simple lines of code will get a web server running on port 8080. We now
  need to add routes so our application can display pages. Let's create a root
  route that says "Hello World". Creating routes in Hono is almost identical to
  Express:
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-jsx">import { Hono } from "hono";

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.text("Hello World");
});

Bun.serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: 8080,
});</code></pre>

<p>
  The <i>app.get</i> method will take in requests coming to "/" (root route) and
  send back text to the user. The c parameter in the callback function can be
  called anything you want. In this example, it stands for context. Now that you
  have your code setup run the following command in your terminal:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-txt">bun index.jsx</code></pre>
<p>
  Head to <i>http://localhost:8080</i> in your browser and you should see a
  blank page with the "Hello World" text at the top:
</p>
<img
  src="/imgs/articles/hello-world.PNG"
  alt="bun server printing hello world on screen"
  class="img-fluid article-img"
/>

<h2>Incorportaing JSX</h2>
<p>
  As stated above, we will be using JSX as our page templates. Using JSX with
  Bun/Hono is very straightforward. Let's create a new folder in the root of our
  project called <i>Views</i>, which will host all our JSX files. Inside this
  <i>Views</i> folder, create a new file called <i>Home.jsx</i>.
</p>

<p>
  We need to make one fundamental change to our <i>tsconfig.json</i> file in the
  root for Hono to be able to render JSX. Add the following (don't delete what's
  already inside your config file; just add the two following properties):
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-json">{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "hono/jsx"
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  If you have prior React experience, this will all be very familiar. We will
  export a functional component from this <i>Home.jsx</i> page that contains
  some text and an image of a cat. Copy the following code inside this file:
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-jsx">export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my website!&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Here is a picture of a cat to make you happy&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;img
        src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/548467d8-c5f1-4551-9f58-6817a8d2c45e/NationalGeographic_2572187_square.jpg"
        alt="cat"
        style="width: 100px"
      /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>

<p>
  With this component ready to go inside our <i>index.jsx</i> file, we need to
  import it. Bun supports ES modules (import/export syntax) and CommonJS modules
  (require/module.exports). You can use either to import this component.
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-jsx">import { Hono } from "hono";
import HomePage from "./Views/Home"; // import the component here

const app = new Hono();

app.get("/", (c) => {
  return c.html(&lt;HomePage /&gt;); // instead of using c.text, use c.html to render JSX components
});

Bun.serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: 8080,
});</code></pre>

<p>
  The JSX component will automatically be rendered into static html using the
  <i>c.html</i> method. Visiting the home route now, you should see something
  like this:
</p>
<img
  src="/imgs/articles/home-component.PNG"
  alt="rendering the home component using hono"
  class="img-fluid article-img"
/>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you just created a simple web server using Bun/Hono/JSX.
  If you thought this was easy, consider trying out Bun for your next JavaScript
  project. Many more built-in features with Bun make developing easier than
  Nodejs.
