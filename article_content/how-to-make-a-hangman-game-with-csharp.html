<p>
  Today, you learn how to build a C# hangman application. The player can also
  choose a difficulty and play as many times as they want. It would be best to
  have a basic understanding of C# before continuing.
</p>

<p>
  Before we start, ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. You
  can download it
  <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >here.</a
  >
</p>

<p>
  You can find the source code
  <a
    href="https://github.com/awoldt/hangman/blob/main/Program.cs"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >here</a
  >
  if you are too lazy to read this article or would like to copy and paste the
  program.

<h2>Generate a New Console Application</h2>
<p>
  First, let's get a template C# console application ready. You can create this
  application in any directory on your computer and name the folder whatever you
  want. Find the place on your machine where you would like to make the project
  and run:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-text">dotnet new console -n {WHATEVER_YOU_WANT_HERE}</code></pre>
<p>
  After running this command, you should have a new folder called hangman (or
  whatever you put after -n) in the current directive. Open up that folder in
  your text editor, and you will see a structure of files similar to this:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-text">- bin/ 
- obj/ 
- hangman.csproj
- Program.cs
</code></pre>

<p>
  The <i>Program.cs</i> file is where all of our application's logic will be
  held. Note that in newer versions of .NET/C#, console applications no longer
  require a manually defined Main method. This simplification eliminates the
  need for explicit setup, allowing developers to dive directly into coding
  application logic. You can read more about this

<div>

  ></ins>
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>
<h2>Create the Game Class</h2>
<p>
  Our entire hangman game will be handled with a new custom class we will create
  called <i>Game</i>. This Game class will contain all the logic for the game to
  function. Let's start by creating this class:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">public class Game {}
</code></pre>

<p>The hangman game will be split into three main parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Selecting a difficulty</p></li>
  <li><p>Randomly generating a word to spell</p></li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Starting the game and only exiting the program when a user no longer wants
      to play
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div>
  <script
    async
    src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
  <ins
    class="adsbygoogle"
    style="display: block"
    data-ad-format="fluid"
    data-ad-layout-key="-gw-3+1f-3d+2z"
    data-ad-client="ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    data-ad-slot="6054250727"
  ></ins>
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>
<h2>Setting the Difficulty</h2>
<p>
  Our game will feature three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard. We will
  create a new enum type to store all these values. Declare this somewhere
  outside of the newly created Game class:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">public enum DifficultyLevel
{
    Easy, // word has length of 4 characters
    Medium, // word has length of 7 characters
    Hard // word has length of 10 characters
}</code></pre>
<p>
  Now, inside our Game class, create a new method called
  <i>SelectDifficulty</i>. This method will run before every game starts. The
  word the player must spell will depend on the difficulty they select. This
  method will display an interactive prompt in the terminal where players can
  switch through the difficulties using the arrow keys on their keyboard. Here
  is the code:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">public DifficultyLevel SelectDifficulty()
{
    int diffIndex = 0; // defaults to easy
    string[] diff = ["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"];

    while (true)
    {
        Console.Clear();
        Console.WriteLine("Choose difficulty:\n");
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
        {
            if (diffIndex == i)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"-&gt; {diff[i]}");
                continue;
            }
            Console.WriteLine($"{diff[i]}");
        }

        ConsoleKeyInfo key = Console.ReadKey(true);

        if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.UpArrow)
        {
            // cant move up if easy
            if (diffIndex != 0)
            {
                diffIndex--;
            }
        }
        else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.DownArrow)
        {
            // cant move down if hard
            if (diffIndex != 2)
            {
                diffIndex++;
            }
        }
        else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.Enter)
        {
            Console.Clear();
            return diffIndex == 0 ? DifficultyLevel.Easy : diffIndex == 1 ? DifficultyLevel.Medium : DifficultyLevel.Hard;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Looking at the method, we can see that it will return the type
  <i>DifficultyLevel</i>, which is the enum we declared above. The
  <i>diff</i> array of strings (each containing a difficulty) and
  <i>diffIndex</i> integer will keep track of what difficulty a user selects.
  For example, the default value for <i>diffIndex</i> is 0, meaning the
  currently selected difficulty for the game would be<i>diff[0]</i> (which is
  easy). A "->" will be displayed next to the currently selected difficulty.
  Pressing the up or down arrows on the keyboard will move this cursor.
</p>

<p>The selection prompt will look like this:</p>
<img
  src="/imgs/articles/hangman-diff-prompt.PNG"
  alt="the selection screen for choosing a difficulty"
  class="img-fluid article-img"
/>

<p>
  This method will keep the player stuck in a loop until they press the
  <i>Enter</i> key on a difficulty, returning the desired difficulty level. This
  method uses the <i>ConsoleKeyInfo</i> C# struct to read in keys pressed. We
  are only looking for three possible keys to be pressed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Up arrow</li>
  <li>Down arrow</li>
  <li>Enter</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">// UP ARROW    
if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.UpArrow)
{
    // cant move up if easy
    if (diffIndex != 0)
    {
        diffIndex--;
    }
}
// DOWN ARROW
else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.DownArrow)
{
    // cant move down if hard
    if (diffIndex != 2)
    {
        diffIndex++;
    }
}
// ENTER
else if (key.Key == ConsoleKey.Enter)
{
    Console.Clear();
    return diffIndex == 0 ? DifficultyLevel.Easy : diffIndex == 1 ? DifficultyLevel.Medium : DifficultyLevel.Hard;
}</code></pre>

<h2>Generating a Random Word</h2>
<p>
  We will need to generate a random word based on the difficulty selected. In my
  program, I have the words being generated as:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Easy words contain 4 characters</p></li>
  <li><p>Medium words contain 7 characters</p></li>
  <li><p>Hard words contain 10 characters</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
  You can adjust the character lengths for your program if you wish. There is an
  easy-to-use API for generating a random word based on a specific number of
  characters:
  <b>https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?length={YOUR_WORD_LENGTH}</b>
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">public async Task&lt;string?&gt; GenerateWord(DifficultyLevel diff)
{
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    string url = "";
    switch (diff)
    {
        case DifficultyLevel.Easy:
            {
                url = "https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?length=4";
                break;
            }

        case DifficultyLevel.Medium:
            {
                url = "https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?length=7";
                break;
            }

        case DifficultyLevel.Hard:
            {
                url = "https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word?length=10";
                break;
            }
    }

    try
    {
        var req = await client.GetAsync(url);
        req.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        var res = await req.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        var words = JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;string[]&gt;(res);
        var RETURN_WORD = words[0];

        return RETURN_WORD;
    }
    catch (Exception err)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(err);
        return null;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Depending on the <i>diff</i> parameter passed into the method, a different URL
  endpoint will be generated and stored in the <i>url</i> variable. This
  endpoint will return a single string and vary in character length.
  <i>RETURN_WORD</i> contains the word a player must guess to win.
</p>

<h2>Start the Game</h2>
<p>
  Now, we can finally start playing the game. Inside our Game class, create a
  new method called <i>Play</i>. This method is asynchronous and will loop
  endlessly until a player chooses not to play a new game. Here is the code:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">public async Task Play()
{
    bool GAMEOVER = false;

    while (!GAMEOVER)
    {
        var attempts = 5;
        var diff = SelectDifficulty();
        var word = await GenerateWord(diff);
        var guessesDisplay = new char[word.Length];
        List&lt;char&gt; guesses = new List&lt;char&gt;();
        // populates the default placeholder chars '_'
        // as user spells word, placeholders will be replaced with letters
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; word.Length; i++)
        {
            guessesDisplay[i] = '_';
        }

        while (attempts != 0)
        {
            // GAME WON
            if (!guessesDisplay.Contains('_'))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("\n\nCONGRATS, YOU GUESSED THE WORD!\nThe word was " + word);
                // play again?
                Console.Write("\nPlay again? (y/n) ");
                var p = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
                while (p != "y" && p != "n")
                {
                    Console.Write("Play again? (y/n) ");
                    p = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
                }
                if (p == "n")
                {
                    Console.Clear();
                    GAMEOVER = true;
                    break;
                }
            }

            Console.WriteLine(string.Join("", guessesDisplay));
            Console.Write("\nGuess character: ");
            var guess = Console.ReadKey();
            Console.WriteLine("\n");

            if (!guesses.Contains(guess.KeyChar))
            {
                guesses.Add(guess.KeyChar);
                // character guessed is within word to guess
                if (word.ToCharArray().Contains(guess.KeyChar))
                {
                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; word.Length; i++)
                    {
                        if (word[i] == guess.KeyChar)
                        {
                            guessesDisplay[i] = guess.KeyChar;
                        }
                    }
                }
                else
                {
                    attempts--;
                }
            }
            else
            {
                Console.WriteLine("- already guessed the character '" + guess.KeyChar + "'\n");
            }
        }

        // game over, could not guess word
        Console.WriteLine("\n-----------------------------------------------");
        Console.WriteLine("\nThe word was '" + word + "'");

        // play again?
        Console.Write("\nPlay again? (y/n) ");
        var playAgain = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
        while (playAgain != "y" && playAgain != "n")
        {
            Console.Write("Play again? (y/n) ");
            playAgain = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
        }
        if (playAgain == "n")
        {
            Console.Clear();
            break;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  The default value for <i>GAMEOVER</i> is false and will loop until it is true.
  After each game, the player will be asked if they would like to play again,
  and if "no" is selected, <i>GAMEOVER</i> will be set to true, and the program
  will end.
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">var attempts = 5;
var diff = SelectDifficulty();
var word = await GenerateWord(diff);
var guessesDisplay = new char[word.Length];
// populates the default placeholder chars '_'
// as user spells word, placeholders will be replaced with letters
for (int i = 0; i &lt; word.Length; i++)
{
    guessesDisplay[i] = '_';
}

List&lt;char&gt; guesses = new List&lt;char&gt;();</code></pre>

<p>
  Five things will occur before a player is allowed to start guessing
  characters. First, we will set the <i>attempts</i> variable to 5. Once
  <i>attempts</i> equal 0, the game will end unless a player can successfully
  guess the word before them. Secondly, we use our
  <i>SelectDifficulty()</i> method we created earlier to set the game's
  difficulty, which directly impacts the third step, generating the word to
  guess with <i>GenerateWord()</i>. Notice how we pass the <i>diff</i> variable
  into the <i>GenerateWord()</i> method. Fourth, <i>guessesDisplay</i> is a
  placeholder for characters to let the user know what guesses they have gotten
  correct.
</p>

<p>
  We initialize the <i>guessesDisplay</i> array with a length of how many
  characters are in the <i>word</i> variable. We will need to loop and place a
  '_' character for each character of <i>word</i> length. For example, if the
  word to guess is 'jack', the <i>guessesDisplay</i> array would be:
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">{'_', '_', '_', '_'}</code></pre>
<p>Now, if the player is to guess 'sack', the array would now be:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">{'_', 'a', 'c', 'k'}</code></pre>
<p>
  This character array will be displayed after each guess to give the player
  feedback on their guesses and help inform their next guess.
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, we initialize a new List of type char called <i>guesses</i>. This list
  will keep track of all guesses made so that if a player accidentally tries to
  guess a character they have already guessed, it won't take an attempt away and
  will display a message letting them know they have already guessed that
  character.
</p>
<p>When the actual game is being played, this is the code that is looping:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">while (attempts != 0)
{
    // GAME WON
    if (!guessesDisplay.Contains('_'))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("\n\nCONGRATS, YOU GUESSED THE WORD!\nThe word was " + word);
        // play again?
        Console.Write("\nPlay again? (y/n) ");
        var p = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
        while (p != "y" && p != "n")
        {
            Console.Write("Play again? (y/n) ");
            p = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
        }
        if (p == "n")
        {
            Console.Clear();
            GAMEOVER = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    Console.WriteLine(string.Join("", guessesDisplay));
    Console.Write("\nGuess character: ");
    var guess = Console.ReadKey();
    Console.WriteLine("\n");

    if (!guesses.Contains(guess.KeyChar))
    {
        guesses.Add(guess.KeyChar);
        // character guessed is within word to guess
        if (word.ToCharArray().Contains(guess.KeyChar))
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < word.Length; i++)
            {
                if (word[i] == guess.KeyChar)
                {
                    guessesDisplay[i] = guess.KeyChar;
                }
            }
        }
        else
        {
            attempts--;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("- already guessed the character '" + guess.KeyChar + "'\n");
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Once the program detects that <i>guessesDisplay</i> does not have a '_'
  character, a user has successfully guessed every character of the
  <i>word</i> variable (aka, they won the game). Until that happens (or when
  attempts equal 0), the user will enter a character one by one using C#'s
  <i>Console.ReadKey()</i> method. If a character guessed is within the word to
  spell, <i>guessesDisplay</i> will replace the '_' with the correct character
  at the specified index.

<h2>Endgame</h2>
<p>
  Once a player guesses the word or attempts is 0, the player will be prompted
  to play again:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-cs">Console.Write("\nPlay again? (y/n) ");
var p = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
while (p != "y" && p != "n")
{
    Console.Write("Play again? (y/n) ");
    p = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();
}
if (p == "n")
{
    Console.Clear();
    GAMEOVER = true;
    break;
}</code></pre>

<p>
  This play again code can appear in two different places in the program, one
  <u>during</u> the game if the player correctly guesses the word before the
  attempts equal 0 or <u>after</u> the game ends and the player cannot guess the
  word. The only difference between the two code snippets is that the first
  mentioned one will set <i>GAMEOVER</i> to true (the above code), which will
  break the player out of the while loop that asks for input and out of the
  parent while loop that keeps them stuck in the game, ending the program
  entirely.
