<p>
  AWS Lambda provides a powerful way to execute code in the cloud without
  worrying about any underlying infrastructure. You can create lambda functions
  with multiple languages, but today, we will focus on JavaScript (Nodejs).
</p>

<p>
  Creating and deploying Lambda functions is very easy. All you need is a couple
  of lines of code and an AWS account. Our function will do the bare minimum and
  log some lines in our console. As of this writing, the latest version of
  Nodejs lambda support is v20. It also supports v18 and v16, but v16 will be
  depreciated in June.
</p>

  <ins
    class="adsbygoogle"

<h2>Create Default Entrypoint File</h2>
<p>
  Creating a lambda function will first require you to create an
  <i>index.js</i> in the root of your project. This file will serve as the entry
  point when your lambda function is invoked. The default Nodejs template we
  will work with should look like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-js">// Handler
// this is the function that will execute
exports.handler = async function(context) {
    console.log('## CONTEXT: ' + JSON.stringify(context));
    console.log("\nHELLO WORLD!");
    
    return null;
}</code></pre>

<p>
  Notice the "handler" function that is exported. This is important as AWS will
  look for this function in your code. This function is passed a
  <i>context</i> object, which will provide information about the invocation and
  execution environment of your function.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of this function, we can return null, indicating to AWS Lambda that
  your function was completed successfully but has not produced any meaningful
  result. We now have a function that is ready to deploy to AWS. It is this
  simple!
</p>


<div>
  <script
    async
    src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
  <ins
    class="adsbygoogle"
    style="display: block; text-align: center"
    data-ad-layout="in-article"
    data-ad-format="fluid"
    data-ad-client="ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    data-ad-slot="5458282521"
  ></ins>
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>
<h2>ZIP Files and Deploy to AWS</h2>
<p>
  We will deploy our code to AWS by uploading a ZIP folder. Another way to do
  this would be through the terminal, which is a little more complicated and not
  what this article is for. The files zipped in this folder must contain:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <i>index.js</i> file we created in the step above</li>
  <li>A default<i>package.json</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
  To generate a <i>package.json</i> file automatically, execute this npm
  command:
</p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-text">npm init -y</code></pre>

<p>
  Once these two files are zipped, you can name the folder anything you want.
</p>

<div>
  <script
    async
    src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
  <ins
    class="adsbygoogle"
    style="display: block; text-align: center"
    data-ad-layout="in-article"
    data-ad-format="fluid"
    data-ad-client="ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    data-ad-slot="5458282521"
  ></ins>
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>

<h2>Upload ZIP Folder to AWS Lambda</h2>
<p>
  As the last step, you will upload your zipped file containing your source
  code, and we can then run the function! Log into your AWS console and find the
  Lambda section. Once here, create a new function, choose the
  <i>Author from scratch</i> template, name your function whatever you want to,
  then choose any of the Nodejs runtimes, and hit create function.
</p>

  alt="AWS lambda console"
  class="img-fluid article-img"
/>

<p>
  Once the function is created, click the upload from dropdown and select
  <i>.zip file</i>
</p>

<img
  src="/imgs/articles/lambda_upload_from.jpg"
  alt="AWS lambda upload from source"
  class="img-fluid article-img"
/>

<p>
  Once your zipped file is uploaded, we can test this function and check the
  logs to see if your code works and if nothing blows up on the server. To
  invoke a test on your function, click the blue Test button and click Invoke at
  the bottom. You don't have to worry much about the Event JSON data; you can
  keep it as is. This JSON data is passed into your function and is accessible
  from the <i>context</i> object mentioned above.
</p>
<img
  src="/imgs/articles/lambda_invoke_function.jpg"
  alt="invoke a test on your lambda function"
  class="img-fluid article-img"
/>
<p>If the function has run successfully, you should see this in the console:</p>
<img
  src="/imgs/articles/lambda_console_function_invoke.jpg"
  alt="successful lambda function execution"
  class="img-fluid article-img"
/>
<p>
  Notice the hello world log and the <i>context</i> object's data. We now know
  this Lambda function has successfully run! From here, you could use AWS API
  Gateway to handle this lambda function or scheduled tasks like cron jobs.
</p>

<div>
  <script
    async
    src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    crossorigin="anonymous"
  ></script>
  <ins
    class="adsbygoogle"
    style="display: block; text-align: center"
    data-ad-layout="in-article"
    data-ad-format="fluid"
    data-ad-client="ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    data-ad-slot="5458282521"
  ></ins>
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you now have a Nodejs Lambda function ready to execute in
  your AWS account. Creating the same function we created above with other
  languages such as Python, Go, Java, and others would be very easy. Lambda can
  be the entire backend of your next application if you want.
