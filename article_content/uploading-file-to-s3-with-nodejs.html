<p>
  Amazon S3 is one of the most easy-to-use and powerful services AWS offers
  developers. You can store practically unlimited amounts of data across many
  buckets while making these files publicly accessible to people online. In this
  article, you will learn how to do just that.
</p>

<p>
  We will be uploading a basic HTML file and a PNG image. Before we begin, make
  sure you have the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>An AWS account</li>
  <li>@aws-sdk/client-s3 npm package installed</li>
</ul>

<p class="mb-0">Initialize a basic nodejs application using:</p>

<pre>
            <code class="hljs language-text language-plaintext">npm init -y</code>
          </pre>

<p class="mb-0">Now install the AWS package:</p>

<pre>
            <code class="hljs language-text language-plaintext">npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3</code>
          </pre>

<div>
  <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout-key="-gw-3+1f-3d+2z"
    data-ad-client="ca-pub-4106301283765460" data-ad-slot="6054250727"></ins>
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<p>
  For our project, we will have a JavaScript file
  <i>(app.js)</i> containing all the logic to interact with S3 and the HTML and
  PNG files sitting in the same project folder. It should resemble this:
</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-text language-plaintext">/s3-tutorial (project folder)
    -app.js
    -helloworld.html
    -cat.png
    -package.json
</code>
          </pre>

<p>You can name the HTML and PNG file whatever you would like.</p>

<div>
  <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4106301283765460"
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display: block" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-layout-key="-gw-3+1f-3d+2z"
    data-ad-client="ca-pub-4106301283765460" data-ad-slot="6054250727"></ins>
  <script>
    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>

<h2>Create a New S3 Bucket</h2>
<p>
  Log into your AWS account and find the S3 service screen. You can locate the
  search bar at the top of the page. Once we are on the S3 page, click the
  Create Bucket button.
</p>
<img src="/imgs/articles/create-bucket-button.png" alt="AWS S3 create bucket button" class="img-fluid article-img" />
<p>
  Once we are on the Create Bucket page, you will have some things to do. First,
  select the region you want to host your bucket. AWS regions specify what
  location you would like to host whatever AWS service you are utilizing; it
  does not matter much what region you choose. Typically, people select the
  regions closest to them, but you can pick any. I will use US East (N.
  Virginia), better known as us-east-1.
</p>
<img src="/imgs/articles/aws-bucket-region.png" alt="selecting s3 bucket region" class="img-fluid article-img" />
<p>
  Now, name your bucket. This name must be globally unique, meaning it cannot
  have the same name as any other bucket in the region you selected.
</p>
<p>
  After naming your bucket, keep the rest of the default settings. Pay attention
  once you get to the
  <i>Block Public Access settings for this bucket</i>.
</p>

<img src="/imgs/articles/block-public-access-bucket.png" alt="block public access section of creating new s3 bucket"
  class="img-fluid article-img" />
<p>
  We want to have this option <b>unchecked</b>. This will allow all files
  uploaded to this bucket to be accessible online so you can share links to your
  files with others.
</p>
<p>
  Keep the rest of the default settings and click the Create Bucket button at
  the bottom of the page.
</p>

<h2>Initialize the S3 Client</h2>

<p>
  To communicate with AWS S3, you need an S3 client in your code that uses your
  specific AWS account's credentials to connect. You can find more about where
  to locate these credentials
  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html" target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. These credentials will consist of an access key and a
  secret access key
  specific to your account.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have both keys for your AWS account, we can start working on the
  code. Inside <i>app.js</i> lets initize an S3 client. As mentioned earlier in
  the article, ensure the <i>@aws-sdk/client-s3</i> package is installed.
</p>

<pre>
            <code class="hljs language-js">const { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3");
const awsS3Client = new S3Client({
    credentials: {
        accessKeyId: "{YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY}",
        secretAccessKey: "{YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}",
    },
    region: "us-east-1",
});</code>
          </pre>

<p>
  From the AWS S3 package, we are importing <i>S3Client</i> and
  <i>PutObjectCommand</i>. The client will be the primary way of connecting to
  our bucket, and the <i>PutObjectCommand</i> is used to send data to the
  bucket. We then initiate a new <i>S3Client</i> object, which takes in two
  parameters: the credentials object (containing our access keys) and the region
  the bucket is hosted (the region you choose to host your bucket). A list of
  all the region names can be found
  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.RegionsAndAvailabilityZones.html"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Use the shorthand name for the region
  for the parameter here. For example,
  US East (N. Virginia) would be <i>us-east-1</i>.
</p>

<h2>Read and Send Files to S3</h2>
<p>
  Now, the fun part. We must read the files from our local directory and upload
  them to AWS. For this, we will utilize the native
  <i>fs/promises</i> Nodejs package. This is similar to the <i>fs</i> package,
  except this is asynchronous and will allow us to use async/await to upload the
  files. If you don't know what that means, don't worry that's not part of this
  tutorial.
</p>

<p>Let's start off by reading the html file. See the code below:</p>

<pre>
            <code class="hljs language-js">const fs = require("fs/promises");
              
async function UploadFiles() {
  // first we are going to read the html file
  const htmlFileData = await fs.readFile("helloworld.html", {
    encoding: "utf-8",
  });
}</code>
          </pre>

<p>
  This will read the file in its entirety with the correct encoding. The value
  returned to <i>htmlFileData</i> will be what is uploaded to S3. We now take
  the client we initiated earlier and plug in the file we just read like this:
</p>

<pre>
            <code class="hljs language-js">const fs = require("fs/promises");

async function UploadFiles() {
  // first we are going to read the html file
  const htmlFileData = await fs.readFile("helloworld.html", {
    encoding: "utf-8",
  });

  await awsS3Client.send(
    new PutObjectCommand({
      Bucket: "491292639630-us-east-1-awoldt", // this should be the exact name of your bucket from the above steps
      Key: `helloworld.html`, // the file name you want stored in S3 (make sure it ends with the correct file extension)
      Body: htmlFileData, // the actual data being updloaded (the file)
      ContentType: "text/html", // this content type header lets s3 how to display it in browser
    })
  );

  console.log("\nsuccessfully uploaded file to S3!");
}

UploadFiles();</code>
          </pre>

<p>
  Go and check your bucket! You should see the file with the name of the
  <i>key</i> property you gave it above. It's that easy. Now, let's do the same
  with the image. Note the code is slightly different for uploading the image.
  We do not want to have the encoding parameter for the <i>fs.readFile</i>
</p>
<pre>
            <code class="hljs language-js">const fs = require("fs/promises");

async function UploadFiles() {
  // first we are going to read the html file
  const catImageDAta = await fs.readFile("cat.png");

  await awsS3Client.send(
    new PutObjectCommand({
      Bucket: "491292639630-us-east-1-awoldt", // this should be the exact name of your bucket from the above steps
      Key: `cat.png`, // the file name you want stored in S3 (make sure it ends with the correct file extension)
      Body: catImageDAta, // the actual data being updloaded (the file)
      ContentType: "image/png", // this content type header lets s3 how to display it in browser
    })
  );

  console.log("\nsuccessfully uploaded file to S3!");
}

UploadFiles();</code>
          </pre>

<div>
  <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4106301283765460"

</div>

<h2>Make Files Accessible to the Internet</h2>

<p>
  Navigate to the <i>properties</i> tab of your bucket. You will see what's
  known as the <i>Amazon Resource Name</i>, or <i>ARN</i> for short. Every AWS
  resource will have a unique ARN assigned to it. We need this string for the
  next step. Make sure to copy it.
</p>

<img src="/imgs/articles/aws-arn.png" alt="aws s3 buckets arn" class="img-fluid article-img" />
<p>
  We need to change the bucket policy now. Don't worry too much about what any
  of this means; just know it is needed for the bucket to have public URLs for
  your files. Copy the following JSON code:
</p>
<pre>
            <code class="hljs language-json">{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": "*",
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "{YOUR_BUCKETS_RESOURCE_ARN}/*"
      }
  ]
}</code>
          </pre>
<p>
  Be sure to replace the <i>{YOUR_BUCKETS_RESOURCE_ARN}</i> with what you copied
  from the last step.
</p>

<p>
  Head over to the <i>permissions</i> tab of your bucket and hit the edit button
  near the bucket policy input. Once here, copy the JSON code from above and
  paste and hit save changes.
</p>

<img src="/imgs/articles/permissions-tab-s3-bucket.png" alt="permissions tab of s3 bucket"
  class="img-fluid article-img" />

<p>
  Your bucket should now be public, and any file inside can be accessed by a
  public URL. Click on one of the uploaded files and and look for its
  <i>object URL</i>.
</p>

<img src="/imgs/articles/s3-file-object-url.webp" alt="object url of an s3 file" class="img-fluid article-img" />

<p>
  Here's an example of what my uploaded file's object URL is -
  <a
    href="https://491292639630-us-east-1-awoldt.s3.amazonaws.com/cat.png">https://491292639630-us-east-1-awoldt.s3.amazonaws.com/cat.png</a>
</p>

<div>
  <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-4106301283765460"

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  🎉 Congratulations, you uploaded two files to AWS S3 and made them public
  online! Try experimenting more and uploading different types of files,
  creating folders in your buckets to store these files in, or creating a script
  that uploads the entirety of your computer's hard drive! The possibilities are
  endless.
